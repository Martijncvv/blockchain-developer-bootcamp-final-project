## Open CleanUp
### An open ecosystem to incentivize individuals to clean the environment. 


## Problem
These days companies and individuals fight environmental damage by sending a certain amount of money to an NGO which works in an opague way and uses a large percentage of the donated money for their expenses. Itâ€™s also hard for the donor to get a feel of the actual result.

## Idea
The idea is to create an open ecosystem whereby large enterprises, SMBs and individuals are incentivized to clean the environment together. This is done by creating a token which will be used to exchange value between different parties within the ecosystem.

Instead of individuals spending hours of walking with a collection box, gathering small amounts of money:  
- **Enterprises** can donate stable coins to an Open CleanUp foundation wallet.
For every dollar donated, 1 $OCU gets minted.
- **SMBs** can sign up to be part of the ecosystem as **token-receiver** that accepts $OCU tokens for services or products which they can exchange for stable coins.  
- **Individuals** can do different kind of tasks to get $OCU tokens.  
- **SMBs or public enterprises**, like a municipal yard nearby a beach, can sign up as **token-distributer** to verify if tasks have been executed and reward individuals.

## Workflow
- The foundation should be able to mint $OCU tokens based on the amount of stablecoins in the donation wallet. 
- Token-distributer SMBs have to register and should get permission from the foundation to distribute minted $OCU tokens to wallets of individuals.
- Token-receiver SMBs have to register and should be able to swap $OCU tokens for stable coins at the foundation wallet; The $OCU token gets burned.

## Extra features
- NFTs can be used to give wallets certain permissions and can be used for gamification;
instead of spending the $OCU tokens, individuals can buy NFTs to show their hard work for the environment. SMBs can give discounts to these NFT holders.
- The individual can see which company donated the specific $OCU tokens; marketing.
- The money donor can see what its donated money was used for.
